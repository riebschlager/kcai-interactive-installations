# Project One - Hello World

The objective of this project is to create an installation, sculpture or other piece of art that demonstrates interactivity. Use the examples we explored in class as your inspiration, but work from your own strengths and expertise. You have the interactive arts space to work with, but your piece can be installed anywhere, or be mobile.
