# Project Two - Alpha to Beta

The goal of this project is to take what you've discovered from Project One and use that learning as the basis for a new installation. You have the interactive arts space to work with, but your piece can be installed anywhere, or be mobile.

# Important Dates

## April 22 - Project Two Done! In-class critique.

# Class Time

We will continue to explore and discuss ideas, technology and relevant work. But two thirds of each night will be your time to focus on your project, ask questions and work through problems. If your work needs to happen outside the space, let's talk about it.

# Collaboration

Collaborations are welcome. All members of a group project will receive the same grade. Please provide a breakdown of each member's role in the completion of the project.
