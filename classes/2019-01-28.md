## Your Links

Dive into the links on the class [README](../README.md) file. Click around. Go down a rabbit hole. Find a project or two that's interesting to you. Be ready to talk about what you found interesting. Send me a link so I can share them here.

- What do you like about it? What do you not like?
- What might you do differently?
- Can you think of something you'd like to make that's similar?
